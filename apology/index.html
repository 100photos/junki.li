			I didn't want any of this, but I knew that if I didn't make a big deal about it, then not only would these lies continue to spread, but that those who have blocked out communication would still not be willing unless I said something that affected them. This was the wrong way to go about things, but unfortunately possibly the only way to go about things.
		</p><p>
			I'm not homophobic, I'm not transphobic, I'm not racist and I don't have the time or patience for any bigotry in my life and I'm disgusted that I would be accused of being so. So when I was told that those accusations were being thrown around about me, while I was messaging someone about the reason I was blocked, I was notably furious, but I wasn't disclosed who was actually spreading these false claims. 
		</p><p>
			Back when I messaged Frey in a screenshot I've already tweeted, they replied by pointing out what other people I was friends with or have talked to in the past were being accused of, but didn't give me an answer to why I was being targeted. I've been looking for answers for months now, so obviously I'm sick and tired of chasing something without reaching a conclusion.
		</p><p>
			So I bit the bullet, I made the assumption that frey was the one spreading these rumors to their friends, and made a lengthy set of tweets in all caps describing the situation and calling people out, while knowing full well that this was not only hypocritical, but immature and irresponsible of me. I regret the decision I've made to accuse someone of spreading lies about me without proper evidence, especially in such a childish way in an all-caps outburst.
		</p><p>
			Without trying to justify my actions, but trying to give some context for them, I was also worried about my music career being affected since some people in this circle of friends have prominence in the scene and label connections. I was worried that these accusations would get in the way of my music career if the rumors made their way to the label connections or their followers. I thought making a pre-emptive response before being publicly accused would be a good move in preventing this, but instead it turned out to be a stupid, very instinctive, and counter-productive decision.
		</p><p>
			I'm sorry to Frey and their friends (except whoever was actually calling me a transphobe fuck you still), I'm sorry to followers of mine and everyone involved for unnecessary drama being spread across the profiles of the artists they listen to. I'm not going to act like I want to be friends with those involved, but I definitely don't want to be enemies, and I hope we can put this behind us. I appreciate the friends who have defended me and/or provided me with comfort despite my foolish decisions and I'm sorry to you as well.
		</p><p>
			I'll be trying my best to do better in the future, making better efforts to reach out directly, denouncing any future false accusations made publicly in a way that doesn't target anyone, and allowing accusations or rumors I know to be false made in private to fall on deaf ears, all in pursuit of being a better artist, person, and friend. Thank you for reading and I look forward to better times in 2021 and beyond.
